# Contributing
## Styleguide
* Use clear naming conventions for variable, function, and branch names, ideally through lower camel case [lowerCamelCase].
* Succinctly describe functions in a way that reflects their complexity.
* Add any unique Steam identifier variant to your contribution or your GitHub profile if you would like to receive in-game items reserved for contributors
## Choosing Contributions
* If you notice a problem that is not already marked as an issue, do not hesitate to open a new issue.
* You are welcome to implement any features that you would like to see, but if you would like to contribute and do not have a feature in mind, please consult open issues and pull requests. Additional contribution value would come from adding to cross-platform capabilities. 
* If a feature that you would like to contribute to a feature that is already being developed in a branch, try to collaborate with the contributor who created the branch.
